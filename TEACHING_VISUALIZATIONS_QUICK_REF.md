## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Best Results:
1. **Review Weekly**: Check visualizations at least once per week
2. **Act on Insights**: Contact students identified as outliers
3. **Optimize Schedule**: Use peak times for important sessions
4. **Track Trends**: Compare different date ranges
5. **Use Filters**: Analyze specific assessment types separately

### Date Range Recommendations:
- **Activity Heatmap**: 2-4 weeks (enough data, not overwhelming)
- **Score Distribution**: 1-3 months (meaningful sample size)
- **Calendar Heatmap**: 3-6 months (shows long-term patterns)
