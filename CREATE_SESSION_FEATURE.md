# Create Session Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The "Create Session" feature allows learners to schedule new tutoring sessions with tutors. This feature is accessible from the Quick Actions section in the Dashboard.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **CreateSession Page** (`frontend/src/pages/CreateSession.jsx`)
A comprehensive form that allows learners to:

#### Features:
- **Skill Selection**: Dropdown to select the skill they want to learn
- **Tutor Selection**: Dynamic dropdown that loads tutors who teach the selected skill
  - Shows tutor name, hourly rate, and rating
  - Automatically filters tutors based on selected skill
- **Date & Time Picker**: 
  - Date must be in the future
  - Separate date and time inputs for better UX
- **Duration Selection**: Preset durations (30 min, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, 3 hours)
- **Session Title**: Auto-populated based on skill (e.g., "Learning JavaScript")
- **Description**: Optional field for additional context
- **Learning Objectives**: Dynamic list where learners can add/remove objectives
- **Pricing Display**: 
  - Shows hourly rate
  - Calculates total amount based on duration
  - Real-time calculation updates

#### Form Validation:
- Required fields: skill, tutor, date, time, duration, title
- Date must be in the future
- Duration must be at least 15 minutes
- All errors displayed inline with helpful messages

#### User Experience:
- Auto-fills title when skill is selected
- Auto-fills hourly rate when tutor is selected
- Loads tutors dynamically based on skill selection
- Shows loading states during API calls
- Success/error toast notifications
- Redirects to Sessions page after successful creation

### 2. **Route Configuration** (`frontend/src/App.jsx`)
- Added route: `/sessions/create`
- Protected route (requires authentication)
- Imported CreateSession component

### 3. **Service Layer Updates** (`frontend/src/services/sessions.js`)
- Enhanced `createSession` method to handle nested response structure
- Proper error handling for API responses

### 4. **Quick Actions Integration** (`frontend/src/components/dashboard/QuickActions.jsx`)
- Tutor users see "Create Session" as first quick action
- Links to `/sessions/create`
- Uses PlusIcon for visual clarity
- Indigo color scheme for prominence

## Backend API Endpoint

### POST `/api/sessions`
**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "tutorId": "string",
  "skillId": "string", 
  "scheduledDate": "ISO 8601 date string",
  "duration": "number (minutes)",
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string (optional)",
  "objectives": [
    { "description": "string", "completed": false }
  ],
  "hourlyRate": "number"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Session created successfully",
  "data": {
    "session": {
      "_id": "session_id",
      "tutor": { "name": "...", "email": "...", "avatar": "..." },
      "learner": { "name": "...", "email": "...", "avatar": "..." },
      "skill": { "name": "...", "category": "...", "difficulty": 7 },
      "scheduledDate": "...",
      "duration": 60,
      "status": "scheduled",
      "pricing": {
        "hourlyRate": 50,
        "totalAmount": 50,
        "currency": "USD"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Backend Validations
The backend performs the following checks:
1. ✅ Tutor exists
2. ✅ Tutor teaches the selected skill
3. ✅ Skill exists
4. ✅ Tutor is available at the requested time (no overlapping sessions)
5. ✅ Session data is valid

4. User selects tutor
    ↓
5. Auto-fill hourly rate from tutor's teaching skills
6. User enters date, time, duration
    ↓
7. Calculate total amount = (hourlyRate × duration) / 60
8. User reviews and submits
    ↓
9. POST /api/sessions
    ↓
10. Backend validates and creates session
11. Sends notification to tutor
    ↓
12. Redirect to Sessions page
    ↓
Session appears in "Upcoming Sessions"
```

## Testing the Feature

### Prerequisites:
1. Database seeded with test data (run `node backend/seed-database.js`)
2. At least one tutor and one learner account
3. Skills and tutors with teaching skills configured

### Test Steps:
1. **Login as a Learner** (e.g., alex.thompson@example.com / password123)
2. **Navigate to Dashboard**
3. **Click "Create Session"** in Quick Actions (right sidebar)
4. **Select a Skill** (e.g., "JavaScript", "Photography")
5. **Observe Tutors Load** dynamically
6. **Select a Tutor** and see hourly rate auto-fill
7. **Choose Date & Time** (must be in future)
8. **Select Duration** (e.g., 1 hour)
9. **Review Total Amount** calculation
10. **Add Learning Objectives** (optional)
11. **Click "Create Session"**
12. **Verify Success Toast** appears
13. **Confirm Redirect** to Sessions page
14. **Check Session Appears** in the list

### Test Cases:
- ✅ Past date validation (should show error)
- ✅ Empty required fields (should show inline errors)
- ✅ Tutor availability conflict (backend returns error)
- ✅ Skill without tutors (shows "No tutors found")
- ✅ Cancel button returns to Sessions page
- ✅ Loading states display correctly

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `frontend/src/pages/CreateSession.jsx` (520 lines)

### Modified:
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Added route and import
- `frontend/src/services/sessions.js` - Enhanced createSession method
- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/QuickActions.jsx` - Already had link configured

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Recurring Sessions**: Allow scheduling multiple sessions at once
2. **Tutor Availability Calendar**: Show tutor's available time slots
3. **Instant Messaging**: Chat with tutor before booking
4. **Session Templates**: Save common session configurations
5. **Payment Integration**: Require payment at booking time
6. **Video Meeting Link**: Auto-generate meeting links for online sessions
7. **Attachment Upload**: Allow learners to attach materials/questions

## Dependencies

No new npm packages required. Uses existing:
- `react-router-dom` - Navigation
- `react-hot-toast` - Notifications
- `@heroicons/react` - Icons
- Existing services and contexts

## Notes

- Feature is **learner-only** - tutors don't create sessions, learners book them
- Tutors receive notification when session is booked
- Session status starts as "scheduled"
- Payment record is NOT created at booking (created when session completes)
- Session can be cancelled later from the Sessions page
