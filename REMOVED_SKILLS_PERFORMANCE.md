# Top Skills Performance Section - Removed

## Changes Made

### ✅ Removed Components

1. **Top Skills Performance Chart Section**
   - Removed the entire horizontal bar chart showing skill performance
   - Removed the chart container with Target icon header
   - Removed ResponsiveContainer with BarChart
   - Removed XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, and Legend components
   - Removed the dual bar display (Sessions and Hours)

### ✅ Code Cleanup

2. **Removed Unused Imports**
   - Removed `Target` icon from lucide-react imports

3. **Removed Unused Data Preparation**
   - Removed `skillPerformanceChartData` variable and its data transformation logic
   - This was mapping `current.skillPerformance` to chart-ready format

### Current Analytics Dashboard Structure

Now the detailed teaching analytics shows **5 interactive visualizations**:

1. ✅ **Session Status Distribution** (Pie Chart)
   - Shows completed, cancelled, and no-show sessions

2. ✅ **Student Engagement** (Bar Chart)
   - Displays new vs returning students

3. ✅ **Rating Categories Performance** (Radar Chart)
   - Multi-dimensional view of rating categories

4. ✅ **Earnings Comparison** (Grouped Bar Chart)
   - Current vs previous period earnings

5. ✅ **Quality Metrics** (Radar Chart)
   - Preparation, Consistency, Professionalism, Overall scores

### Why This Was Removed

The Top Skills Performance section was likely redundant or not needed for the primary teaching analytics view. The remaining 5 charts provide comprehensive insights into:
- Session performance
- Student engagement  
- Teaching quality ratings
- Financial metrics
- Quality assessment

### Files Modified

- `frontend/src/components/analytics/DetailedTeachingAnalytics.jsx`
  - Removed lines: ~27 lines of code
  - Cleaned imports
  - Removed data preparation logic

### No Errors

✅ Component compiles successfully  
✅ No syntax errors  
✅ No unused variables  
✅ All remaining charts functional
