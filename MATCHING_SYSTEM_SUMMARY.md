## 🎓 Demo Script (5-minute presentation)

### **Introduction (30 seconds)**
"I've built an intelligent matching system that connects learners with the most suitable tutors using a sophisticated scoring algorithm."

### **Backend Demo (2 minutes)**
1. Show the API endpoint: `GET /matching/tutors?skillId=...`
2. Explain match score calculation:
   - "The algorithm considers 4 factors with different weights..."
   - Show example calculation: "This tutor scores 85% because..."
3. Demonstrate filters:
   - "I can filter by price, rating, location, and skill level"

### **Frontend Demo (2 minutes)**
1. Open Find Tutors page
2. Show platform statistics
3. Select a skill from filter
4. Point out match scores on cards
5. Demonstrate sorting by "Best Match"
6. Show skill recommendations (if implemented)

### **Technical Explanation (30 seconds)**
"The frontend uses React with Tailwind CSS, communicates with Express backend via REST API, and MongoDB stores user and skill data. The match score is calculated server-side for security and consistency."
