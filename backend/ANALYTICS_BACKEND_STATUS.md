## 🔐 Authentication

All analytics endpoints are **protected** and require:
- Valid JWT access token
- User must be authenticated
- Endpoints return data only for the authenticated user

---

## 📈 Data Sources

Analytics data is aggregated from:

1. **Session Collection**
   - Completed, scheduled, cancelled sessions
   - Session duration and timing
   - Feedback and ratings

2. **User Collection**
   - Learning skills with progress levels
   - Teaching skills with ratings
   - User reputation and stats

3. **Skill Collection**
   - Skill categories
   - Difficulty levels
   - Usage statistics

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### Database Queries
- Uses MongoDB aggregation pipelines for complex calculations
- Filters data by timeframe to reduce payload
- Populates only necessary fields

### Recommended Indexes
Already created in models:
```javascript
// User model
{ email: 1 }
{ "teachingSkills.skillId": 1 }
{ "learningSkills.skillId": 1 }
{ role: 1 }

// Session model
{ learner: 1, status: 1 }
{ tutor: 1, status: 1 }
{ scheduledStartTime: -1 }
```

### Future Optimization
- Implement Redis caching for analytics (5-10 min TTL)
- Pre-calculate daily aggregates
- Use database views for complex queries

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
Use the provided cURL commands in `ANALYTICS_API_DOCUMENTATION.md`

### Test Checklist
- [ ] Login and get access token
- [ ] Call `/api/users/analytics?timeframe=30d&metrics=learning`
- [ ] Call `/api/users/me/progress`
- [ ] Call `/api/users/me/achievements`  
- [ ] Call `/api/sessions/statistics`
- [ ] Verify data structure matches frontend expectations
- [ ] Test with different timeframes (7d, 30d, 90d, 1y)
- [ ] Test error handling (invalid token, no data)

### Expected Response Times
- Analytics endpoint: < 500ms
- Progress endpoint: < 200ms
- Achievements endpoint: < 100ms
- Session stats endpoint: < 300ms
