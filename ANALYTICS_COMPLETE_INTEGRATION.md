#### 2. **Analytics Page** (`frontend/src/pages/Analytics.jsx`)
Modern, interactive dashboard featuring:
- **Gradient stat cards** with hover animations
- **Area chart** for progress over time
- **Circular progress indicator** with SVG animation
- **Bar chart** for time by category
- **Pie chart** for session distribution
