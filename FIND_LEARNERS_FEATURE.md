- Protected route (requires authentication)
- Imported FindLearners component

### 3. **Quick Actions Integration**

## Backend API Endpoint

### GET `/api/matching/learners`

**Query Parameters:**
```javascript
{
  skillId: "string",           // Filter by skill learners want to learn
  location: "string",          // Search city or country
  minLevel: "number",          // Minimum skill level (0-10)
  maxLevel: "number",          // Maximum skill level (0-10)
  learningStyle: "string",     // visual, auditory, kinesthetic, reading
  page: "number",              // Page number (default: 1)
  limit: "number",             // Results per page (default: 12)

}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "learners": [
      {
        "_id": "learner_id",
        "name": "John Doe",

  }
}
```

## Key Features Explained

### 1. **Match Score Calculation**
When a skill filter is applied, the backend calculates a match score (0-100%) based on:
- Skill compatibility
- Experience level alignment
- Learning style preferences
- Past session success rate

### 2. **Level System**
- **0-2**: Beginner
- **3-5**: Intermediate
- **6-8**: Advanced
- **9-10**: Expert

Tutors can filter learners by their current skill level to find students at the right level for their teaching expertise.

### 3. **Learning Styles**
Helps tutors find learners whose learning style matches their teaching style:
- **Visual**: Learn best through images, diagrams, charts
- **Auditory**: Learn best through listening and discussion
- **Kinesthetic**: Learn best through hands-on practice
- **Reading/Writing**: Learn best through text and notes

### 4. **Smart Filtering**
- Filters update results in real-time
- Multiple filters can be combined
- Easy to clear all filters at once
- Filter state persists while browsing

## Flow Diagram

```
Dashboard (Tutor) → Quick Actions "Find Learners"

## Testing the Feature

### Prerequisites:
1. Database seeded with test data (learners with learning skills)
2. Login as a tutor account
3. Ensure tutors have teaching skills configured

### Test Steps:
1. **Login as a Tutor** (e.g., sarah.johnson@example.com / password123)
2. **Navigate to Dashboard**
3. **Click "Find Learners"** in Quick Actions (second button, green)
4. **View All Learners** initially displayed
5. **Click "Show Filters"** to expand filter panel
6. **Test Skill Filter**:
   - Select a skill you teach (e.g., "JavaScript")
   - Observe learners filtered to those learning that skill
   - Note match scores appear
7. **Test Location Filter**:
   - Enter a city (e.g., "New York")
   - See learners from that location
8. **Test Level Range**:
   - Set Min Level: 0, Max Level: 3 (Beginners only)
   - Observe only beginner learners shown
9. **Test Learning Style**:
   - Select "Visual"
   - See only visual learners
10. **Test Sorting**:
    - Change sort to "Rating"
    - Observe highest-rated learners first
11. **Clear Filters** and verify all learners return
12. **Test Pagination** if >12 learners
